# Data Collection & Local Storage Plan

> **Doc type:** Decision-first design record (load-bearing)
> **Status:** DRAFT — proposed, not yet locked. Architecture authority remains `LOCAL_FIRST_RESEARCH_WORKBENCH_SPEC.md`; this doc refines the data-collection + storage slice of that spec and must yield to it on any conflict.
> **Drafted:** 2026-06-07 (from the data-collection-audit workflow). Promote to **Adopted** only after the §10 open questions are locked.
> **Scope:** How ArkScope collects market/news/SA data, at what cadence, where it is stored (local-first SQLite vs remote PostgreSQL), how it migrates off remote PG, how price data is layered for charting, and how `daily_update.py` is repositioned. Companion to the three canon docs (Workbench Product Spec / Provider Catalog / Tool Catalog).

## 0. Status & decision summary

ArkScope collects data in **three distinct modes** that today are blurred together inside one batch script and one remote database. This doc separates them and pins down storage.

**Decision (summary):** Collection is split into (1) **manual backfill** (heavy, on-demand historical pulls), (2) **incremental-scheduled** (the protected news/price ingestion that keeps the cockpit fresh), and (3) **realtime-display** (ephemeral live quotes for the chart edge — *not yet implemented*, snapshot-only today). User state moves to a **three-way local SQLite split** — `profile_state.db` (precious user work), `market_data.db` (regenerable provider mirror, DuckDB candidate), `sa_capture.db` (isolated Seeking-Alpha capture). **Remote PostgreSQL** (`<postgres-host>:<port>`) is now an explicit **transitional archive/import backend**, not the desired runtime architecture. The product end state is: app reads and writes local stores directly; PG is only a legacy import/export/archive path. `daily_update.py` is reframed as a transitional/manual backfill runner while app-owned scheduling and provider adapters take over. Price data adopts a **3-tier granularity model** (ephemeral realtime / short-retention intraday / permanent adjusted daily) with all chart indicators computed **deterministically from OHLCV, never by the LLM**. The Seeking-Alpha extension → native-host path is a **protected ingestion pipeline** and must keep working byte-for-byte through the migration.

**2026-06-15 runtime-retirement clarification:** the PG → SQLite mirror was a migration bridge, not the product architecture. `scripts/migrate_market_to_sqlite.py`, `scripts/migrate_sa_to_sqlite.py`, and `scripts/migrate_to_supabase.py` are cutover/operator tools, not app features. They stay until every runtime writer has a local authority and rollback/export is proven; after that they move to legacy/archive or are deleted.

**What is explicitly NOT in scope here:** the RL-trading line (retired), continuous *user-state* sync (a separate desktop concern, must not be layered onto the batch runner), and v2 knowledge-graph / analysis-pipeline work (deferred per SPEC §11).

## 1. Three collection modes

| Mode | What it is | Providers / jobs | Trigger | Persistence target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Backfill (manual / on-demand)** | Heavy historical pulls to seed or repair the data store. Expensive, Gateway/provider-dependent, run explicitly by the operator or app. | IBKR prices (full history), IV / options history, full-universe fundamentals, daily-adjusted history (`fetch_adjusted_prices`) | Explicit flag or operator action (never swept in automatically — see §7) | Local domain stores; legacy PG import path only during transition |
| **B. Incremental-scheduled** | The protected freshness path: small deltas that keep cards/charts current. | **Polygon news**, **Finnhub news**, **IBKR news** (Gateway-gated), 15min IBKR price deltas; LLM sentiment/risk scoring (`news_scores`) | App-owned scheduler; cron/manual CLI only as transitional/advanced fallback | Local domain stores; PG → local mirror only while R2 is incomplete |
| **C. Realtime-display (ephemeral)** | The live edge of the chart: forming candle, blinking last price, intraday % change. | IBKR live market data | Continuous while a symbol is open in the UI | **In-memory only** (no persist by default) |

**Status notes:**
- Historical audit snapshot: Modes A and B originally ran through `scripts/collection/daily_update.py` (subprocess orchestrator) → sibling `collect_*.py` → `scripts/migrate_to_supabase.py` → remote PG. That is no longer the product target. Current direction is app-owned scheduling + provider adapters that write local domain stores; any remaining PG path is transitional and tracked by §4a.
- **Mode C is NOT implemented.** Today the only "realtime" is a one-shot snapshot: `data_sources/ibkr_source.py:926` (`get_current_quote` → `reqMktData(contract, '', True, False)` with `snapshot=True`, then a blocking 2s sleep). **There is no `reqRealTimeBars`, no `reqTickByTick`, no `pendingTickersEvent` subscription anywhere** — a continuous live stream is new code to build.

## 2. Provider / job frequency model

Per-source cadence, retention, health surface, and cost gate. Provider-level data/latency/cost facts are authoritative in **`ARKSCOPE_PROVIDER_CATALOG.md`**; this table is the *collection-cadence* view.

| Source / job | Enabled | Refresh mode | Interval | Retention / downsample | Health fields | Cost gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Polygon news** | yes | scheduled (`--incremental`) | hourly–daily | Parquet raw, permanent | connected / stale / last_success / last_error | free (tiered) |
| **Finnhub news** | yes | scheduled (`--incremental`) | hourly–daily | Parquet raw, permanent | connected / stale / last_success / last_error | free (rate-limited; 429-prone → circuit breaker §9) |
| **IBKR news** | yes (Gateway-gated) | scheduled (`--incremental`) | daily | Parquet raw, permanent | connected / maintenance (Gateway down) / last_success / last_error | free (needs IB session); **known limitation:** `reqHistoricalNews` ignores time-range (`docs/data/IBKR_NEWS_API_LIMITATIONS.md`) |
| **IBKR prices — 15min (base)** | yes (Gateway-gated) | scheduled / backfill | daily delta; backfill on demand | base granularity, ~1–2y; live PG = **2.25M rows, 148 tickers, 2024-01-02→2026-06-05, `15min` only** | connected / maintenance / last_success / last_error | free (IB session) |
| **IBKR prices — 1m / 5m** | proposed | backfill | manual | 1m ~30–60d, 5m ~6–12m (§6) | as above | free; pacing ≤60 hist reqs/10min (`ibkr_source.py:223-229`) |
| **IBKR prices — 1d (adjusted)** | proposed | backfill | manual / periodic | **permanent** (`fetch_adjusted_prices`, `ADJUSTED_LAST`, `ibkr_source.py:1163`) | as above | free (IB session) |
| **IV / options history** | yes (Gateway-gated) | **opt-in backfill** (currently swept by `--all` — see §7) | manual | `iv_history`, permanent | connected / maintenance / last_success / last_error | free (IB session); heavy |
| **Fundamentals** | yes | manual / cached | on demand | TTL: annual 180d / quarterly 90d / ttm 30d | connected / stale / last_success / last_error | **fallback chain:** IBKR snapshot → SEC EDGAR (free) → Financial Datasets (**metered**, cached). Not wired into `daily_update.py` (absent, not stale). |
| **Macro / calendar (FRED + Finnhub)** | yes | scheduled | per release schedule | `macro_*`, `cal_*` tables → **`macro_calendar.db`** (its own DB; see §4b/topology — NOT market_data.db) | per-table count + last-fetched (`macro_calendar_health.py:449-459`) | free |
| **Analyst consensus (Finnhub)** | yes | scheduled cache | 24h TTL | daily cache | connected / stale / last_success | free |
| **LLM sentiment/risk scoring** | yes | scheduled (piggybacks news today — to decouple, §7) | with news | `news_scores`, permanent | n/a (compute job) | **metered** (LLM API cost) |
| **SA capture (extension)** | yes | **realtime push** (user browses) + extension-driven refresh | event-driven | `sa_*` tables, permanent | per-scope `sa_refresh_meta` (last_attempt/last_success/snapshot_ts/row_count/ok/last_error, `db_backend.py:1224-1234`) | free (user session); **protected path** §5 |
| **Realtime quote stream (Tier 0)** | **NO (to build)** | realtime | continuous while symbol open | none (memory) | connected / stale / maintenance | free (IB session) |

**Cost-gate vocabulary:** `free` (no marginal cost) · `metered` (per-call API cost, must show usage) · `manual-approval` (operator must explicitly enable per run — reserved for paid backfills, e.g. Financial Datasets bulk pulls).

> **Open analysis (carried from the deleted `scripts/comparison/compare_sec_vs_financial_datasets.py`, 2026-06-11):** the QUESTION it asked stays relevant — what can SEC EDGAR provide/derive vs what the paid Financial Datasets API returns (field coverage, statement depth, freshness)? The one-off script is gone (git-recoverable); redo the gap analysis in-app when the fundamentals providers are wired into the workbench surface, to decide when the paid fallback is actually worth a metered call.

**Provider-health vocabulary (surfaced in the ops view):** `connected` · `stale` (last_success older than TTL) · `maintenance` (provider/Gateway intentionally down or unreachable) + timestamps `last_success` / `last_error`. These map directly onto the DSA `ProviderRun` telemetry and `CircuitBreaker` state (§9).

## 3. Local DB split

Three SQLite files, each with a distinct durability/backup policy. Path resolution mirrors the existing pattern in `src/api/dependencies.py:30-79` (`_local_state_db_path`).

### 3a. `profile_state.db` — precious local-first user state (back up aggressively)
The "lose-this-and-you-lose-the-user's-work" DB. Three modules **already share this one file today** (`ARKSCOPE_PROFILE_DB`):
- `src/profile_state.py` (`:36-98`) — lists/memberships/notes/meta/tags/settings
- `src/card_runs.py` (`:13`, `:26-47`) — `ai_card_runs`
- `src/model_credentials.py` (`:81-94`) — `llm_credentials`

### 3b. `market_data.db` — regenerable provider mirror (**SQLite first**, DuckDB later)
High-volume, read-heavy in the cockpit, regenerable from providers. Folds in the
currently-standalone `data/cache/analyst_consensus.db` (`ARKSCOPE_CONSENSUS_DB`).
**Engine decision (2026-06-07): the first cut is SQLite (WAL + busy_timeout), NOT
DuckDB.** Reason: incremental jobs WRITE while the UI READS concurrently, and
SQLite's WAL + `busy_timeout` is the better-controlled story for mixed small
write + concurrent read (same hardening already used by the other stores). DuckDB
remains the long-term **analytic / read-heavy** engine — used as a batch /
materialized read model over the SQLite (or Parquet) market data, **not** as the
target for multi-process high-frequency small writes. Do not point the extension
or any high-write job directly at DuckDB.

### 3c. `sa_capture.db` — isolated Seeking-Alpha capture (regenerable by re-capture)
Written **exclusively** by the extension → native-host path, independent of the API server's request lifecycle. Isolated for lock-blast-radius and schema-evolution reasons (§5f below).

### Table → DB mapping

| Table(s) | Target DB | Source today | Citation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `watchlists`, `watchlist_memberships`, `ticker_notes`, `ticker_meta`, `ticker_tags`, `profile_settings` | **profile_state.db** | already local SQLite | `profile_state.py:36-98` |
| `ai_card_runs` | **profile_state.db** | already local SQLite (same file) | `card_runs.py:26-47` |
| `llm_credentials` | **profile_state.db** | already local SQLite (same file) | `model_credentials.py:81-94` |
| `prices` | **market_data.db** | remote PG | `db_backend.py:591` |
| `fundamentals` | **market_data.db** | remote PG | `db_backend.py:657` |
| `iv_history` | **market_data.db** | remote PG | `db_backend.py:635` |
| `financial_data_cache` | **market_data.db** | remote PG | `db_backend.py:1029,1053` |
| `analyst_consensus` | **market_data.db** | separate `data/cache/analyst_consensus.db` (fold in) | `analyst_consensus.py:27-39` |
| `macro_series`, `macro_observations`, `macro_release_dates` | **`macro_calendar.db`** (revised 2026-06-23; was market_data.db — see §4b) | remote PG | `store.py:457,528,598` |
| `cal_economic_events`, `cal_earnings_events`, `cal_ipo_events` + `*_revisions` | **`macro_calendar.db`** (revised 2026-06-23) | remote PG | `store.py:219/303/388` |
| `news`, `news_scores`, `news_latest_scores` | **market_data.db** | remote PG | `db_backend.py:334,354,398` |
| `sa_alpha_picks`, `sa_refresh_meta`, `sa_market_news`, `sa_articles`, `sa_article_comments`, `sa_comment_signals` | **sa_capture.db** | remote PG | `db_backend.py:1200,1226,1405,1624,1699`; `comment_signal_backfill.py:223` |
| `agent_queries`, `agent_memories`, `research_reports`, `job_runs` | **transitional PG / mixed local** (retire under §4a R1/R3) | remote PG + local stores where already migrated | `db_backend.py:1001,859/931,752/807`; `job_runs_store.py` |
| `symbol_catalog` (ticker→name) | **JSON file** (`data/cache/sec_company_tickers.json`, not a DB) | reference data | `symbol_catalog.py:10-12` |

**Backend mechanics:** introduce a `SqliteBackend`/`LocalBackend` implementing the existing `DataBackend` protocol (`db_backend.py:248`) alongside `DatabaseBackend`. The DAL already abstracts backend choice (`data_access.py:166-197`), so call sites in `sa_tools.py`, card/report tools, and the native host **do not change** — only the backend the DAL constructs.

### 3d. DAL domain routing (required for PG + local to coexist)
A single-backend DAL **cannot** express "market data → local SQLite, but SA + app
records → PG" — which is exactly the migration's intermediate state (and the
deliberate end state for SA until its quiet-window cutover). So slice 3 adds a
**composite / domain-routing backend**: the DAL dispatches each operation to a
backend by **data domain**, not one global backend.

| Domain | Backend (target state) |
|---|---|
| profile (lists/tags/priority/notes/cards/credentials) | `profile_state.db` (SQLite) — already local |
| market (prices/news/fundamentals/IV/consensus) | `market_data.db` (SQLite) |
| macro / calendar (FRED + Finnhub) | `macro_calendar.db` (SQLite; revised 2026-06-23 — its own DB) |
| SA capture (`sa_*`) | **PG for now** → `sa_capture.db` only at the §5g quiet-window cutover |
| app records (`agent_queries`/`agent_memories`/`research_reports`/`job_runs`) | **transitional PG** → local app-state store in the PG-retirement track (§4a) |

This routing is what lets slice 3a (market → local) ship **without** touching SA,
and lets SA keep writing PG on weekdays. Each domain keeps its own
`DatabaseBackend`(PG) or `SqliteBackend`(local) instance behind the protocol.

---

## 4. PostgreSQL → local migration strategy (phased)

PG was kept as the source of truth during the early migration because it was the only complete runtime store. That is a transitional stance, not the target. The retirement rule is:

> A domain may stop depending on PG only when its reads **and writes** have a local authority, failures are observable, and a rollback/export/import path exists.

Cutover order = lowest blast radius first.

> **Decision (2026-06-23) — desktop-app PG exit + `news_scores` retirement.** ArkScope
> is a **desktop app**: normal runtime must not require a reachable PG. PG is demoted to
> **import / archive / backfill tooling only** — never a daily-read fallback. Consequences:
>
> - **`news_scores` / `news_latest_scores` are RETIRED, not migrated.** The 1–5 LLM scores
>   aren't provider-refetchable (they cost LLM spend to recompute) and **no UI surfaces
>   them**; the AI-card evidence path already excludes them by design (`evidence_packet`,
>   `scored_only=False`, pure-objective). Replacement is **LLM sentiment written on-demand**
>   when an analysis/card runs over an article, going forward — **no backfill**.
> - **What shipped (slice A):** the local `news` table carries a single OPTIONAL 1–5
>   `sentiment_score` (CHECK-enforced `IS NULL OR BETWEEN 1 AND 5`) plus `sentiment_source` /
>   `sentiment_scale` **provenance/metadata** (TEXT). It does **not** yet have a numeric
>   provider-polarity column — **provider-native sentiment (e.g. Polygon −1/0/+1) is a FUTURE
>   addition that will need its OWN scale-tagged column**, because the CHECK makes it
>   impossible (correctly) to store a polarity in the 1–5 field.
> - **Scale invariant (load-bearing, ENFORCED not conventional):** `sentiment_score` is
>   **strictly 1–5** — the CHECK constraint physically rejects a provider polarity, so it can
>   never silently poison `get_news_sentiment_summary` (≥4 bullish / ≤2 bearish) / `min_sentiment`
>   / strategies. `sentiment_source`/`sentiment_scale` document provenance + scale, they are
>   NOT a numeric store.
> - **`scored_only=True` no longer falls back to PG.** No local/provider sentiment → honest
>   empty/unavailable. Pure-news-context callers (`context_builder`) use `scored_only=False`
>   so a missing score never withholds the news itself.
> - **Q3 reversal:** app records (`agent_queries`, `agent_memories`, `research_reports`,
>   `job_runs`) move from "stay PG" to **transitional → local** (desktop-app requirement).
>   `research_reports`/`agent_memories` = precious one-time migrate; `agent_queries`/`job_runs`
>   may start fresh locally.

| Phase | Tables moving | Why this order | What stays in PG meanwhile |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 0 — no-op** | none | `profile_state.db` is already local SQLite; nothing to migrate. | everything market/SA/app |
| **Phase 1 — market_data** | `prices`, `fundamentals`, `iv_history`, `financial_data_cache`, `news` (articles). **`news_scores`/`news_latest_scores` = RETIRED, not migrated** (see §4 decision 2026-06-23). **`macro_*`/`cal_*` moved OUT of market_data → their own `macro_calendar.db`** (revised 2026-06-23). `analyst_consensus` is provider-fetched live (regenerable; not a backend PG read). | **Regenerable** — safe to migrate and re-fetch on mismatch. Read PG via current backend → write local; validate by row counts + content checksum on a sample. The macro/calendar health query (`macro_calendar_health.py:449-459`) is a ready per-table count/last-fetched cross-check. | SA tables; agent/app records |
| **Phase 2 — sa_capture** | `sa_alpha_picks` (+ lifecycle), `sa_refresh_meta`, `sa_market_news`, `sa_articles`, `sa_article_comments`, `sa_comment_signals` | **Single-writer, re-capturable.** Must port the **partial-index `ON CONFLICT … WHERE` upserts** (`db_backend.py:1170-1196`) — SQLite supports partial-index upserts, but the index predicates must be recreated as real partial indexes in the new schema. | agent/app records |
| **Phase 3 — app records (revisit)** | `agent_queries`, `agent_memories`, `research_reports`, `job_runs` | Lower priority; decide local vs remote after the user-facing split is stable. | — |

**PG-ism translation checklist (apply during every port):** `NOW()` → `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`; `psycopg2.extras.Json` → `json.dumps`; `%s` → `?`; `RealDictCursor` → `sqlite3.Row`; partial-index upserts recreated as real partial indexes.

**Path resolution:** env override (`ARKSCOPE_MARKET_DB`, `ARKSCOPE_SA_DB`, reuse `ARKSCOPE_PROFILE_DB`) → default under `data/`, resolved next to `_local_state_db_path` (`dependencies.py:76-79`). `DatabaseBackend` is kept as a legacy/import backend behind the same protocol while domains migrate. Live fallback is allowed only as an explicit transition mechanism; after hard cutover, fallback must be disabled so stale PG data cannot mask split-brain.

### 4a. PG runtime retirement track (explicit)

This is separate from the "one DB vs many DBs" decision. Adding more SQLite files is an implementation tool; **removing PG runtime dependency is the product requirement**.

**Required gates before PG can leave runtime:**
1. **All runtime reads are local-first or hard-local** for their domain.
2. **All runtime writes have a local authority**; no app/scheduler/extension path writes only to PG.
3. **Provider/source → local update paths exist.** PG → local incremental mirror is transitional and must be replaced by provider adapters writing local state directly.
4. **App records are local or deliberately retired:** `job_runs`, provider health, research threads, reports, memories, and agent query history must not require PG for normal use.
5. **SQLite write failures are observable and non-lossy:** bounded transactions, WAL, `busy_timeout`, file/process locks where needed, explicit retry/skip semantics, and telemetry for dropped/skipped runs. "It only locks briefly" is acceptable only when no data is silently lost and the user can see stale/failed status.
6. **Provider-growth review passes:** every new provider/collector declares whether it writes through the app-owned scheduler/write path or requires its own source DB/inbox (`LOCAL_STORAGE_TOPOLOGY.md` §3).
7. **Cross-machine smoke passes:** copy the local profile/data directory to a second machine and run the app without PG.
8. **Rollback/export/import story exists:** legacy PG import can rebuild local state, but daily runtime must not need PG.

**Retirement phases:**
| Phase | Goal | Main work |
|---|---|---|
| **R0 — inventory + guardrails** | Know every remaining PG runtime caller. | `rg`/AST gate for `DatabaseBackend`, raw `psycopg2`, `migrate_to_supabase.py`, and direct DSN use; mark each caller as runtime / migration / test / legacy. |
| **R1 — local app telemetry** | Remove PG from health/scheduler observability. | Move `job_runs` and provider-health run records to a local app-state store (likely `profile_state.db` or a small `app_state.db` if write pressure proves real). |
| **R2 — provider adapters write local** | Replace PG → local mirror. | Scheduler sources write to local domain stores directly; `incremental_update()` becomes provider/source → local, not PG → local. For each source, apply the provider-growth rule: in-process low-frequency sources may write canonical DB directly; independent/high-frequency/bursty sources get a source DB or inbox first. |
| **R3 — local app records** | Remove PG from agent/research product use. | Ensure research threads, reports, memories, and agent query records are local and exportable. |
| **R4 — disable live PG fallback** | Stop stale fallback masking bugs. | Domain-by-domain hard local mode, with explicit operator import fallback only. |
| **R5 — retire scripts** | Remove migration scripts from runtime. | Move `scripts/migrate_market_to_sqlite.py`, `scripts/migrate_sa_to_sqlite.py`, and `scripts/migrate_to_supabase.py` to `scripts/legacy/` or delete after documented recovery alternatives exist. |

### 4b. Market local strict-readiness (data-completeness, not just routing)

**Status:** plan locked 2026-06-23 (design workflow + review). Strict mode (`e49cabc`/`c474221`)
makes the *runtime* not need PG, but the local DB is not yet *complete/fresh* enough to
enable it without degrading research. These are the gaps to close BEFORE flipping
`use_local_market_strict` on for real.

**Root cause of the price sparsity (verified, important):** `incremental_update()` →
`_incr_prices` is a **PG→SQLite mirror**, not provider→SQLite. `market_sync_meta(prices)` =
0 rows / no error today → the mirror is healthy; **PG itself is stale** (the IBKR
`collect→PG` step has been partial/failing since ~6/10, and nothing detects per-ticker
gaps — `local_market_stats` reports only the global `MAX(datetime)`). So price freshness
needs a **direct provider→SQLite** path, not a mirror fix.

**Topology (all market domains stay in `market_data.db` — a separate DB = split-brain):**

| # | Area | Fix (concrete) | Target | Risk/Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Ticker canon** | `ticker_aliases` table + resolve-on-read canonical resolver; PK-SAFE row reconciliation (INSERT OR IGNORE canonical → delete alias rows only after → per-table row-count audit); fixes `BRK B`/`BRK.B`/`BRK-B`. **prices PK unchanged.** | market_data.db | low / M |
| 2 | **Price direct backfill** | NEW `market_data_direct.py`: `_normalize_utc` (byte-identical UTC PK string), `detect_price_gaps` (per-ticker-per-trading-day, weekend/holiday + early-close aware — NOT a hardcoded 26 bars), `backfill_prices_direct` (IBKR primary behind the scheduler IBKR lock + Polygon fallback → `INSERT OR IGNORE`); new scheduler source, coexists with the mirror (idempotent). **MUST canonicalize the ticker BEFORE insert** (apply the canon map at write time, not just read) — else a provider writing an alias spelling (`BRK.B`) re-creates the cross-domain split inside `prices`, and a same-PK collision would be silently dropped by `INSERT OR IGNORE` (making row totals diverge — validation note §4b·2). | market_data.db + `provider_sync_runs`/`provider_sync_meta` (NEW; do NOT reuse `market_sync_meta`, which means "PG mirror") | med / L |
| 3 | **Fundamentals gap** | NEW `fundamentals_backfill.py`: gap-detect vs active universe → free **SEC EDGAR** → snapshot JSON into `fundamentals`. (~23 Core tickers missing.) | market_data.db | low / M |
| 4 | **News sentiment fill** | (a) persist Polygon polarity → **new scale-tagged columns** (`provider_sentiment`/scale), NEVER the 1-5 CHECK `sentiment_score`; (b) LLM-on-analysis is the only 1-5 writer, going forward. (Today: 362,975 news, 0 scored.) | market_data.db `news` | low / M |
| 5 | **IV source/method** | add `iv_source`/`iv_method`/`as_of` + natural-key UNIQUE; dual-source (self-computed + externally-pre-computed); widen by priority. (Today: 4 tickers, 24 rows, stale.) Lowest priority. | market_data.db `iv_history` | low / M |

**Sequence:** 1 canon → 2 price (the big knife; own review; **strict mode safe to ENABLE only after this**) → 3 fundamentals → 4 sentiment → (then §macro/cal local store) → 5 IV.
**Cross-cutting end-state:** once direct writes are authoritative + validated, **demote the PG
iv/prices/fundamentals mirror OUT of the runtime `incremental_update` loop → import/archive
only** (else stale PG remains a silent runtime source, conflicting with strict-local).

### 4c. Macro / calendar local store — SCOPING (`macro_calendar.db`)

**Status:** scoping locked 2026-06-24; not yet built. `MacroCalendarStore` (`src/macro_calendar/store.py`)
is still **raw psycopg2** (`is_available()` = `_backend has _get_conn`), so macro/cal is the
largest remaining market/research PG runtime dependency. Its own DB (`macro_calendar.db`) per
the topology decision — distinct schema + lifecycle from market_data.db, independently
re-fetchable (FRED/Finnhub), and a rebuild must not be able to harm prices/news.

**Grounded surface (verified):** 8 tables (`sql/013`) — 4 canonical (`cal_economic_events`,
`cal_earnings_events`, `cal_ipo_events`, `macro_series`) + their revision logs / observations
(`cal_*_event_revisions`, `macro_observations`, `macro_release_dates`); `BIGSERIAL` PKs,
`fingerprint TEXT UNIQUE` upserts (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT`), `TIMESTAMPTZ`, partial indexes
(`WHERE impact='high'`), FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Readers: `macro_calendar_tools.py` (+ both
agent tool bridges), `macro_calendar_health.py`, `fred_ingestion.py`/`finnhub_ingestion.py`
(writers), `api/app.py` (wiring), `agents/config.py` (`macro_calendar_enabled`).

**The 6 locked scoping decisions:**
1. **Schema** — port `sql/013` to SQLite in `macro_calendar.db` (PG-ism checklist: `BIGSERIAL`→
   `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`; `TIMESTAMPTZ`→TEXT UTC-ISO; `JSONB`→TEXT(json.dumps);
   `%s`→`?`; `RealDictCursor`→`sqlite3.Row`; partial-index `WHERE` recreated as real partial
   indexes; FK CASCADE kept). Fingerprint-UNIQUE upserts + the canonical+revisions pattern
   port directly (SQLite supports `ON CONFLICT` + partial unique indexes).
2. **Store shape** — a **SQLite-backed twin** (`MacroCalendarLocalStore`) over the SAME public
   method surface (`upsert_*`, `get_macro_series`, `get_macro_value_as_of`, `get_release_dates`,
   `is_available`) rather than abstracting a Protocol now — mirrors the slice-#2 LocalMarket
   precedent (smallest change; a Protocol is over-engineering for one twin). Selected by a
   `use_local_macro` toggle (env + profile_settings), default-off, like `use_local_market`.
3. **PG fallback** — import/archive only; once the local store is validated, runtime reads/writes
   are local. A one-time PG→SQLite migrate (like market_data) seeds history; provider re-fetch
   is the steady state. No silent live PG fallback after cutover (strict-local consistent).
4. **FRED/Finnhub re-fetch vs migrate** — both: a one-time migrate seeds existing PG rows
   (cheap, preserves revision history), then `fred_ingestion`/`finnhub_ingestion` write the
   local store directly going forward. Migrate first (parity proof), re-fetch is the R2 end-state.
5. **Health route** — `macro_calendar_health.py` reads the local store's per-table count +
   last-fetched (the same DTO), local-first; PG only as the labeled fallback until cutover.
6. **boot-without-PG tests** — the store + ingestion + health resolve against a temp
   `macro_calendar.db` with NO PG (a `_pg_conn`-raises guard, like the strict-market tests);
   a read on a missing/empty DB is an honest empty, not a crash.

**Implementation order:** (1) SQLite schema + `MacroCalendarLocalStore` read/write **parity tests**
(hermetic, no PG) → (2) toggle + wire selection in `api/app.py` → (3) routes/tools/health
local-first → ~~(4) one-time PG→SQLite migrate + validate~~ **SKIPPED — see decision below** →
(5) FRED/Finnhub ingestion writes local. **NOTE:** enabling `macro_calendar.enabled` today
routes to the PG-only path — do NOT flip it on until the local store lands (would regress the
PG-exit direction).

**DECISION 2026-06-25 — migration (step 4) SKIPPED, PG macro/cal verified EMPTY.** Before
building the migrator I checked the source: all 9 PG macro/cal tables have exact `COUNT(*)=0`
and `job_runs` shows the FRED/Finnhub ingestion jobs **never ran** (the feature was schema-only,
gated off — consistent with the `macro_calendar.enabled` note above). A PG→SQLite migration
would copy zero rows, so it's a no-op and is dropped from the mainline. The migrator is
downgraded to a **later optional import/archive tool** — only worth building if some machine
ever accumulates PG macro/cal history by another path. The real path to local data is **slice 4
(provider→local writes) + running ingestion once** to populate `macro_calendar.db` fresh from
FRED/Finnhub. Sequencing now: slice 2 (done) → **slice 4** (ingestion via `get_macro_calendar_store`,
default-off) → run local ingestion → verify routes/tools/health serve local data → later decide
whether to default `use_local_macro` on / expose a Settings toggle.

## 5. Seeking-Alpha capture isolation (protected ingestion path)

The SA capture pipeline is an **existing, protected ingestion path** — the migration must keep it working byte-for-byte. It must NOT be treated as a future feature.

### 5a. Write path (extension → native host → DAL → backend)
1. **Browser extension** `extensions/sa_alpha_picks/background.js` captures SA pages → `chrome.runtime.sendNativeMessage`.
2. **Native messaging host** `scripts/sa_native_host.py` (host id `com.mindfulrl.sa_alpha_picks` — **intentionally lowercase `mindfulrl`, do not "fix"**) — Chrome spawns a **fresh, short-lived process per message**, reads length-prefixed JSON, then `dal = DataAccessLayer(db_dsn="auto")` and dispatches by action (`sa_native_host.py:59-90`).
3. **All persistence flows through DAL → `DatabaseBackend` → PG today**, e.g. `refresh` → `dal.apply_sa_refresh(...)` (`sa_native_host.py:210`; `db_backend.py:1137-1234`), `refresh_failure` → `dal.record_sa_refresh_failure(...)` (`:236`/`:1257`), `save_detail[_by_symbol]` (`:320/350`), market news (`:387/423`), articles/comments (`:443/607/627`).

### 5b. Alpha Picks open → closed lifecycle (lives in `sa_alpha_picks`)
- `portfolio_status` ∈ {`current`, `closed`}; `closed_date`; `return_pct`; and an **`is_stale`** flag set when a row is absent from the latest snapshot.
- Upserts use **partial unique indexes per status** (`db_backend.py:1160-1220`) — this is the exact construct that needs careful porting in Phase 2.

### 5c. Capture-health DTO (`sa_refresh_meta`)
Per-scope capture health: `last_attempt` / `last_success` / `snapshot_ts` / `row_count` / `ok` / `last_error` (`db_backend.py:1224-1234`). This is the SA-specific health surface that feeds the ops view (§8) alongside the generic provider-health fields.

### 5d–5f. Why `sa_capture.db` is its own file
- **Separate process boundary:** Chrome spawns the native host fresh per message, outside the FastAPI server; a separate DB file means its connections never contend with the API server's connections.
- **Lock blast radius:** SQLite locks at the file level. A long SA refresh/backfill (bulk comment inserts `db_backend.py:1699`; `comment_signal_backfill.py:223`) holding a write lock would otherwise stall unrelated cockpit reads. Isolation confines any `database is locked` stall to SA reads.
- **Independently-evolving schema:** SA has the richest, fastest-changing schema (lifecycle, market news, threaded comments with parent re-parenting `db_backend.py:1764`, derived signals). Its own file lets that schema migrate without risking the user's hand-curated `profile_state.db`.

### 5g. Cutover window (the SA extension is always running)
The extension → native-host path writes continuously while the user browses SA. Re-pointing its DB target (PG → `sa_capture.db`) needed a **quiet window** so no capture landed mid-cutover. Decision (2026-06-07): do the `sa_capture` cutover on a Saturday with US markets closed (target 2026-06-13), after a dry run + row-count/checksum validation on a copy.

**Status 2026-06-15:** cutover executed successfully; `sa_capture.db` is the live SA runtime store, PG `sa_*` tables are frozen rollback/archive baseline. See `SA_CUTOVER_3D_RUNBOOK.md`.

---

## 6. Price granularity & retention

### Current state (verified)
- **API exposes only 3 intervals:** `interval ∈ {15min, 1h, 1d}`, regex-pinned (`src/api/routes/prices.py:19`); same enum in `registry.py:277-278` and both agent bridges (`anthropic_agent/tools.py:184`, `openai_agent/tools.py:228`).
- **Only `15min` is STORED.** Live PG `prices` = **2,248,970 rows, 148 tickers, `15min` only, 2024-01-02 → 2026-06-05; zero `1h`/`1d` rows.** Schema `sql/001_init_schema.sql:35-46`, `UNIQUE(ticker, datetime, interval)`.
- **`1h`/`1d` are derived on read, never stored:** server-side `date_trunc` aggregation over `15min` (`db_backend.py:600-619`); FileBackend mirrors with a Python resample (`price_tools.py:23-59`).
- **Only `15min` is ingested to PG:** `migrate_to_supabase.py:490,521,545` (hardcoded `"15min"` literal). The collector *does* fetch `1 hour`/`1 day` into CSV/`data/prices/hourly/` (`collect_ibkr_prices.py:390,504`) but **those are never loaded into PG** — stray files at best.
- **IBKR source can do far more:** full bar ladder `1 secs … 1 month` (`ibkr_source.py:201-207`); fetch methods `fetch_prices` (`:633`), `fetch_intraday_prices` (`:717`), `fetch_historical_intraday` (auto-chunked: 1min≈10d, 5min≈30d, 15min≈60d per req, `:786,819-825`), `fetch_adjusted_prices` (`ADJUSTED_LAST`, `:1163`).

**Net gap:** UI can request `1d`/`1h`, but every non-`15min` bar is recomputed from `15min` each call → **no daily history older than the 15min floor (~Jan 2024), no sub-15min detail, no realtime stream.**

### Layered proposal (3 tiers)

| Tier | Interval(s) | Source method | Stored? | Retention | Derivation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Realtime display** | live ticks / 5s bars | **stream to build** (`reqRealTimeBars` / `reqTickByTick` / non-snapshot `reqMktData` + `pendingTickersEvent`) | no (memory) | session | roll up → 1m, then discard |
| **1 — Short-term intraday** | 1m, 5m | `fetch_historical_intraday` (auto-chunked) | yes | 1m ~30–60d, 5m ~6–12m | 1m→5m→15min rollup |
| *(base)* | 15min | `fetch_historical_intraday` | yes (live: 2.25M rows) | ~1–2y | base for 1h |
| **2 — derived hourly** | 1h | — | no (derive) | — | `date_trunc` from 15min (existing `db_backend.py:603-616`) |
| **2 — Long-term daily** | 1d | `fetch_adjusted_prices` (`ADJUSTED_LAST`) | **yes (NEW)** | permanent | native; store `adj_close` |

**Mechanics:**
- New interval values `'1m'`/`'5m'`/native `'1d'` reuse the existing `(ticker, datetime, interval)` key — **no migration needed**, just widen the `VARCHAR(10)` usage and the API regex/enum (`prices.py:19`, `registry.py:278`, both bridges).
- Promote the on-read `date_trunc` SQL (`db_backend.py:603-616`) to **one reusable rollup** so all intervals share the same first-open/last-close/max-high/min-low/sum-volume definition.
- For Tier 2, **store both unadjusted and adjusted close** (`adj_close` column for `1d`; the IBKR dataclass already carries it) so split discontinuities don't corrupt long charts or indicator math.
- Keep on-read aggregation as the **fallback** (a missing interval still renders) but prefer native stored `1d` so daily history isn't bounded by the 15min floor.
- **Session awareness:** carry RTH vs extended-hours (`useRTH`) so gaps render correctly. Volume sub-panel is free wherever bars exist (schema already has `volume`).

### Deterministic technical indicators (from OHLCV — NOT LLM)
All chart indicators are computed **deterministically from stored OHLCV, never produced by the LLM** (the LLM narrates; numbers come from the data). This enforces the signal-subsystem rule: *AI-card evidence stays pure-objective — clean OHLCV technicals, NO judgment.* Indicators the chart layer derives directly:
- **Trend/overlays:** SMA/EMA (20/50/200), VWAP (needs intraday volume, Tier 0/1), Bollinger Bands.
- **Momentum/oscillators:** RSI, MACD, stochastic, ROC.
- **Volatility/range:** ATR, realized/historical volatility, true range, range bands. (Compute from our own OHLCV, not IBKR's `HISTORICAL_VOLATILITY` `whatToShow`, for consistency.)
- **Volume-based:** OBV, volume MA, relative volume, accumulation/distribution.
- **Returns/change:** already deterministic — `get_price_change` (`price_tools.py`), `get_sector_performance` (`prices.py:28,38`).

Implement as a small pure-Python/pandas (or SQL-window) module in the FastAPI sidecar, computed server-side and shipped with the bars — reproducible, testable, LLM-free.

## 7. `daily_update.py` new positioning + old-model pollution to remove

> **✅ IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-08** (commits `a765c85` + follow-up `c70b83d`). All three
> couplings below are removed; the script is now a backfill runner with explicit
> `--scope active-universe` / `--tickers`, opt-in `--scores`, and dry-run that never
> touches DB/IBKR. **The `line NNN` references below are PRE-slice-2 (the audit
> snapshot); the code has since shifted — they document what *was* found, not current
> line numbers.**

**File:** `scripts/collection/daily_update.py` (historically 881 lines before the 3e-E step-down). It used to be a **subprocess orchestrator** over sibling `collect_*.py` and `migrate_to_supabase.py`, touching **remote PG only**. Current direction: keep it as a compatibility/backfill wrapper over the same app-owned source runners and local write paths; no RL/reward/PPO references belong here.

### New positioning
Reframe as a **manual / on-demand backfill runner / legacy compatibility wrapper** — explicitly *not* the desktop app's continuous-sync engine. The always-on workbench sidecar owns product scheduling. During the transition, the CLI can still run operational backfills, but it must converge toward the same provider adapters and local write paths as the app.

Principles:
- **Keep the protected ingestion collectors LIVE while adapting their writer boundary:** Polygon, Finnhub, and IBKR news collection must keep working, but the runtime write target migrates toward local authority via the app scheduler/provider adapters.
- **Make heavy/stateful steps opt-in, not bundled under `--all`:** IV history (`:618`), full-universe IBKR prices (`:597`), and `--scores` DB push (`:668`) each require their own explicit flag.
- **Clarify the DB boundary:** remote-PG sync via `migrate_to_supabase.py` is transitional. Product runtime writes must end in local domain stores; local user-state DBs remain separate from regenerable market/provider data.

### Old-model pollution to REMOVE (cited)

**(a) `user_profile.yaml → tickers_core.json` writeback — VERIFIED def `line 112`, unconditional call `line 784`.**
`sync_watchlist_tickers(dry_run=…)` runs on **every** non-`--status` invocation, before any flag branching: reads `user_profile.yaml` watchlists (`_extract_watchlist_tickers` `:80-98`), diffs against `tickers_core.json` (`:101-109`), and **writes new tickers into `tier3_user_watchlist.watchlist_auto_sync`** (`json.dump` `:177-179`). This couples the data-fill job to the **retired tier model** (`tier1_core`/`tier2_expanded`/`tier3_user_watchlist`) and to `user_profile.yaml`, both superseded by the SQLite active-universe + 2D-tags model. It silently mutates a tracked config file as a side effect. **Action:** remove the call at `:784` and the now-dead helpers `:80-182`.

**(b) `--tier all` IBKR price dependency — VERIFIED `line 597`.**
`cmd = [sys.executable, str(script), "--incremental", "--minute-only", "--tier", "all"]`. `--tier all` resolves in `collect_ibkr_prices.py` to **all three retired tiers** (`tier1_core` + `tier2_expanded` + `tier3_user_watchlist`, `:105-108`; argparse choices `:557-559`), forcing a full legacy-universe pull in one Gateway session. **Action (Q7 LOCKED):** drop `--tier all`; the scope must be **explicit** — either `--tickers <list>` or `--scope active-universe`, the latter **READING** the SQLite active universe (`profile_state.db`) **read-only** (it must never write back to `user_profile.yaml`/`tickers_core.json`). `--all` must NOT implicitly guess a scope.

**(c) `--sync-db` scores sync — VERIFIED `line 668` (real lines `666-672`).**
Comment `# Also sync multi-model scores` (`:666`) → `cmd = [… "--scores"]` (`:668`) → run (`:671`) → record (`:672`). It **piggybacks on the news-sync branch** (`if sync_news:` `:658`), so any news collection with `--sync-db` force-pushes LLM sentiment/risk `news_scores` into PG even when no new scoring was produced. This is **not RL writeback** (confirmed) but is an old-pipeline coupling. **Action:** make `--scores` a **separate, explicit step**, not an automatic tail of every news fill.

> **Note on fundamentals:** NOT wired into `daily_update.py`. `migrate_to_supabase.py` supports `--fundamentals` (argparse `:697`) but `daily_update` never builds that command — so fundamentals is **absent here, not stale**.

---

## 8. Settings / System UI controls to expose

Driven by the Provider Catalog (per-provider auth/limits) and the health vocabulary above.

**Provider configuration (Settings):**
- Per-provider enable/disable + credential entry (IBKR Gateway host/port — `data_sources/IBKR_GUIDE.md` already anticipates this; Polygon/Finnhub/FRED API keys; Financial Datasets paid toggle).
- Refresh-mode + interval selector per source (manual / scheduled / realtime), matching §2.
- Cost-gate acknowledgement for **metered** sources (Financial Datasets, LLM scoring): show estimated cost, require explicit enable for `manual-approval` backfills.
- Retention knobs per price tier (1m days, 5m months — §6).

**System / ops health view (small, *inside* the workbench — not the product surface):**
- Per-provider status chip: `connected` / `stale` / `maintenance` + `last_success` / `last_error` (from `ProviderRun` telemetry §9).
- SA capture health from `sa_refresh_meta`: per-scope last_attempt/last_success/snapshot_ts/row_count/ok/last_error.
- Circuit-breaker state per source (closed/open/half-open).
- Job-run log (`job_runs`) + last backfill summary.
- DB location + size per local file (`profile_state.db` / `market_data.db` / `sa_capture.db`); migration status (which phase, PG-fallback active?).

*(This ops view is the post-pivot repositioning of the P1.5 S3 spike — a small health view inside the workbench, not a standalone admin product.)*

## 9. Borrow from `daily_stock_analysis` (US-first)

Source repo confirmed at `<workspace>/daily_stock_analysis`. The provider/fallback design lives in code (no narrative doc). **Borrow these five; skip all A-share machinery.**

### BORROW

| Capability | File / location | Why it fits ArkScope |
|---|---|---|
| **Unified realtime-quote dataclass with quality metadata** | `data_provider/realtime_types.py` → `UnifiedRealtimeQuote` (L108-187), `RealtimeSource` enum (L94-105) | One provider-neutral quote struct with `fetched_at`/`provider_timestamp`/`is_stale`/`stale_seconds`/`fallback_from` layered on price+volume. Lets ArkScope merge IBKR/Polygon/Finnhub into one card-facing type and **show provenance + staleness** instead of a bare number. `to_dict()` drops `None`s (clean JSON for sidecar→React); `safe_float`/`safe_int` coercion helpers (L34-91) normalize messy payloads. Treat `code` as a US ticker; A-share idioms (`turnover_rate`/`amplitude`/`circ_mv`) stay `None`. |
| **Manager-side quote enrichment (centralized staleness)** | `data_provider/base.py` → `_enrich_realtime_quote` (L1470-1501), `_parse_realtime_timestamp` (L1436) | The **orchestrator** (not each fetcher) stamps `fetched_at`, computes `stale_seconds`, sets `is_stale = stale_seconds > ttl` (default 600s). Adapters stay "dumb" (raw → quote); the one tricky bit (tz-aware staleness) lives in one place — exactly ArkScope's sidecar contract. **Lesson to copy, not bug to inherit:** Finnhub's `t` epoch is dropped (`finnhub_fetcher.py` L132-147) so its quotes get `is_stale=None`. **Wire each adapter's native timestamp through** (Finnhub `t`, IBKR tick time, Polygon `t`). |
| **Circuit breaker (per-source failure cooldown)** | `data_provider/realtime_types.py` → `CircuitBreaker` (L279-433) + getters (L437-458) | Thread-safe CLOSED→OPEN→HALF_OPEN keyed by source: N failures (default 3) trip a cooldown (default 300s), one half-open probe decides recovery; `record_inconclusive` handles "returned None but didn't error." Stops ArkScope hammering a rate-limited/down provider (Finnhub 429s, IBKR Gateway drop). Run **separate tuned instances per workload** (realtime vs fundamentals). |
| **Provider-health telemetry: per-trace run records (fail-open)** | `src/services/run_diagnostics.py` → `ProviderRun` (L90-126), `RunDiagnosticContext` (L264-300, contextvar-scoped), `record_provider_run()` (L347), `sanitize_diagnostic_text` (L73-87) | Structured record of every provider attempt: provider/operation/success/latency_ms/error_type/fallback_from/fallback_to/cache_hit/stale_seconds/record_count. **Fail-open + contextvar-scoped** (no-ops when no context) → never breaks a request. This is the queryable history behind the §8 ops view; `card_runs`-style table is a natural sink. Built-in secret-redaction is a bonus given local credential storage. |
| **Duck-typed availability probe + capability filtering** | `data_provider/base.py` → `_is_fetcher_available`/`_call_availability_probe` (L646-673), `_filter_fetchers_by_capability` (L718-741), priority registry in `__init__.py` | Manager asks each provider in order `is_available_for_request(capability)` → `is_available()` → `_is_available()`, defaulting to available. With integer `priority` + per-capability pre-filtering, this is the clean **"IBKR if Gateway up → Polygon → Finnhub"** fallback model. **Lift the pattern, not the 133KB `base.py`.** |

### SKIP (A-share / CN-only, not US-relevant)
- All CN/HK fetchers: `efinance_fetcher.py`, `akshare_fetcher.py` (+ `is_hk_stock_code`), `tushare_fetcher.py`, `pytdx_fetcher.py`, `baostock_fetcher.py`, `longbridge_fetcher.py`.
- `prefetch_realtime_quotes` bulk-pull (`base.py` L1350-1429) — exists only for CN "全量" whole-market endpoints; irrelevant to US per-symbol APIs.
- `ChipDistribution` + `_chip_circuit_breaker` (`realtime_types.py` L190-276) — 筹码分布 is a CN-retail concept with no clean US source. (Keep only the *idea* of a second tuned breaker for a flakier endpoint.)
- `us_index_mapping.py` + market-routing branches (`_is_us_market`/`_is_hk_market`, `_filter_daily_fetchers_for_market`) — multi-market dispatch is dead weight; keep a flat US chain.
- CN exchange-prefix parsers `normalize_stock_code`/`is_bse_code`/`is_st_stock`/`canonical_stock_code` (`base.py` L68-271).
- `alphavantage_fetcher.py` — borderline (US-capable, last-resort supplement). SKIP unless a 4th free fallback is specifically wanted.

**Files to read when implementing:** `data_provider/realtime_types.py` (entire, ~460 lines, self-contained); `data_provider/base.py` L1456-1501 + L646-741 + L1503-1655 (fallback loop reference); `src/services/run_diagnostics.py` L90-300; clean US adapter reference `data_provider/finnhub_fetcher.py` L27-147.

## 10. Decisions on the open forks (2026-06-07)

**LOCKED (user):**
- **Q6 — LLM scoring decoupling: `--scores` is a FULLY separate opt-in step.** Not tied to `--news`/`--sync-db` at all. (Slice 2.)
- **Q7 — `--tier all` replacement: explicit scope, read-only.** The IBKR price scope is sourced from the SQLite active universe **only via an explicit `--scope active-universe`** flag (read-only: it READS `profile_state.db`, never writes config). The CLI also supports `--tickers`. **`--all` must NOT implicitly guess a scope**, and nothing here may write back to `user_profile.yaml`/`tickers_core.json`. (Slice 2.)

**RECOMMENDED defaults (gpt-5.5; lock before the dependent slice):**
- **Q1 — Realtime stream: DEFER.** v1 uses snapshot/poll (`get_current_quote`) with an explicit `is_stale` indicator; build `reqRealTimeBars` only after the chart shell is stable. (Slice 4.)
- **Q2 — `market_data` engine: SQLite-first acceptable for the low-risk first cut; DuckDB is the long-term target** for market/time-series OLAP. (Slice 3.)
- **Q3 — app records (`agent_queries`/`agent_memories`/`research_reports`/`job_runs`): ~~STAY in PG~~ → TRANSITIONAL → LOCAL** (revised 2026-06-23 for the desktop-app PG exit). Still NOT in the market_data slice — but they no longer "stay PG": `research_reports`/`agent_memories` = precious one-time migrate, `agent_queries`/`job_runs` may start fresh locally. (Phase 3 / retirement track R1+R3.)
- **Q4 — Daily-history backfill depth: ≥ 5 years of adjusted `1d`, ACTIVE universe only** (not whole-market). (Slice 4.)
- **Q5 — Intraday retention: 1m ~30–60d, 5m ~6–12m, 15m ~1–2y.** (Slice 4.)

## 11. Implementation slices

| Slice | Scope | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| **Slice 1 (this slice)** | This decision doc + the docs inventory it sits beside. Establishes the three modes, the DB split target, and the daily_update repositioning as the shared plan of record. No code change. | — |
| **Slice 2 — `daily_update.py` cleanup** ✅ DONE (`a765c85`+`c70b83d`) | Removed the three old-model couplings: `sync_watchlist_tickers` writeback (a); `--tier all` → explicit `--tickers` / `--scope active-universe` (physically read-only `mode=ro` read of `profile_state.db`, no config writeback) (b); `--scores` is a fully separate opt-in (c). Polygon/Finnhub/IBKR-news collectors unchanged. `--all` excludes IV + never guesses a price scope; dry-run never touches DB/IBKR. | Slice 1; **Q6/Q7 LOCKED ✓** |
| **Slice 3a — market_data local-first (NO SA)** | Add the **domain-routing** DAL (§3d) + `SqliteBackend`; migrate Phase 1 (`market_data` — regenerable) to `market_data.db` (SQLite, WAL) with row-count + checksum validation; keep PG fallback. **SA stays on PG; app records stay on PG.** Weekday-safe (no extension impact). **▸ PRICES landed `e95ebef`** (CompositeBackend + SqliteBackend + opt-in routing; 2.25M rows migrated + parity-verified). **News landed in 3b**; `iv_history`+`fundamentals` landed in 3c-A, `financial_cache` (local-primary) in 3c-C — all done. | Slice 2; Q2/Q3 |
| **Slice 3b — news local (articles + FTS5)** ✅ DONE (`af6ef75`+`a868037`) | `news` articles → local (NO scores; news_scores deferred). SqliteBackend query_news (unscored) + query_news_search (FTS5, porter+unicode61 stemming, LIKE fallback <3 chars); LocalMarketDatabaseBackend overrides both local-first w/ PG fallback; **scored reads + query_news_stats stay PG** (need scores). Unified `bootstrap_market` builds prices+news+FTS5 in one atomic-swap rebuild; status/validate per-domain; route renamed `/market-data/bootstrap`. Verified on real data: 338,456 news / 3 sources migrated, query_news article-identity parity exact, FTS5 42,320 hits for "earnings". | Slice 3a.1 |
| **Slice 3a.1 — market_data lifecycle substrate** ✅ DONE (`55fca56`+`ee8a01f`+`82a4636`) | Productize the prices migration as an app feature (no CLI): `src/market_data_admin.py` (status / bootstrap-with-atomic-swap / validate / in-process job runner) + `/market-data/*` API (status·bootstrap·jobs·validate·settings) + **persisted `use_local_market` toggle** (profile_settings, read by the DAL; env still overrides) + Settings → **Data Storage** panel (build/rebuild w/ progress, validate, toggle). DAL cache invalidated on toggle/bootstrap-done (no restart). `migrate_market_to_sqlite.py` thinned to a CLI over the shared core. | Slice 3a-prices |
| **Slice 3a.2 — incremental updater** ✅ DONE (`afcc52b`+`cfac094`) | Append-only delta refresh so the local DB stays fresh without full rebuilds: `incremental_update()` (prices WHERE datetime>local-max; news WHERE id>local-max + FTS sync; in-place WAL append, routing stays active; provider failure per-domain = recorded `market_sync_meta.last_error`, not fatal) + `start_update_job` + POST `/market-data/update`; status carries per-domain sync meta; Settings 增量更新 button + "最近增量更新" line. | Slice 3b |
| **Slice 3c-A — IV + fundamentals local** ✅ DONE (`7523006`) | `iv_history` + `fundamentals` → local (id-keyed; id-based incremental; per-ticker COUNT+SUM(id) checksum). SqliteBackend `query_iv_history`/`query_fundamentals` (same shapes as PG) + LocalMarketDatabaseBackend overrides (local-first, PG fallback) + `bootstrap_market`/`validate_market`/`incremental_update` extended. Verified real data: 24 iv / 130 fundamentals MATCH + per-ticker read parity (0 mismatches). | Slice 3b |
| **Slice 3c-B — surface IV/fundamentals in Settings + API** ✅ DONE (`d64f00c`) | `/market-data/status` + TS types + Settings "Data Storage" panel report all 4 domains (row/ticker/latest, sync, per-domain validate ✓/✗). Also fixed `start_update_job` to weigh all 4 domains (was prices/news only). | Slice 3c-A |
| **Slice 3c-C — financial_cache LOCAL-PRIMARY** ✅ DONE (`95a5241` + mutex follow-up) | `financial_cache` is local-primary, NOT a PG mirror: SqliteBackend `get_financial_cache` (local, expiry-checked) + `set_financial_cache` (local-only write, the one writable path; WAL+busy_timeout); LocalMarketDatabaseBackend get = local-first → PG fallback → read-through promotion (preserves PG source+TTL), set = local-only never PG. `bootstrap_market` carries the cache over the atomic swap under `_CACHE_WRITE_LOCK` (read-old→swap→write-carried, serialized vs set_financial_cache so a racing write isn't dropped) + clears stale `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars. Not validated vs PG, untouched by incremental. **`financial_datasets_client.py` rewire ✅ DONE:** the paid client takes `cache_backend` (the DAL backend) — reads go backend (local-first/PG-fallback/promotion) → legacy file (read-only; hits promoted into the backend w/ remaining TTL) → API; writes go to `set_financial_cache(source='financial_datasets')` (no own-PG writes; healthy path writes no files, but a FAILED backend write logs a WARNING and falls back to the legacy file — deliberate paid-cost protection, do not remove; next read promotes it back into the backend). Standalone (no backend) keeps legacy env-PG+file behavior. | Slice 3c-A |
| **Slice 3d — SA capture cutover** ✅ DONE | `sa_*` PG → `sa_capture.db` hard cutover completed 2026-06-13; follow-up #1 ported `extract_sa_comment_signals` to SQLite and added `get_sa_comment_focus`; C-1 added `/sa/feed` + News-surface SA filter. PG `sa_*` is frozen as rollback/archive baseline, not live runtime. | Slice 3a; §5g |
| **Slice 3e — Settings / schedule controller** ✅ SUBSTRATE DONE | App/sidecar is the scheduler owner; cron is transitional/advanced fallback. Shipped provider health, per-step job telemetry, Settings Data Sources panel, app-managed provider credentials, per-source scheduler, adapterized news collectors, explicit Universe scope, and `daily_update.py` as a thin wrapper over the app run-source path. Remaining work belongs to PG-retirement R1/R2 and future provider telemetry depth (Slice 5), not to cron-first architecture. | Slice 3c |
| **Slice 3f — PG runtime retirement** | Execute §4a: inventory remaining PG callers, move `job_runs`/provider telemetry local, convert provider adapters from PG→local mirror to source→local writes, localize/retire app records, disable live PG fallback, then move/delete migration scripts after recovery alternatives exist. Provider-growth rule decides whether each new source writes canonical DB directly or gets a source DB/inbox. | Slice 3e; stable local stores |
| **Slice 4 — Charting + price tiers** | Widen interval enum (`1m`/`5m`/native `1d`); persist adjusted `1d` (`adj_close`); reusable rollup; deterministic-indicator module in the sidecar; (optional) Tier 0 realtime stream. | Slice 3a; Q1/Q4/Q5 |
| **Slice 5 — Provider health + signals surface** | **Owns the FULL DSA borrow (§9)** — quote dataclass / enrichment / circuit breaker / `ProviderRun` telemetry / capability filtering (3e deliberately ports none of it; 3e-A's health DTO is ProviderRun-compatible so this plugs in); deepen the §8 ops health view with per-call telemetry + circuit-breaker state; integrate with the multi-factor signals subsystem (kept-but-adapt). | Slice 3e; §9 |
